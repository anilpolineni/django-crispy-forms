# Django template language

* This document explains the language syntax of the Django template system.
* Django’s template language is designed to strike a balance between power and ease.
* It’s designed to feel comfortable to those used to working with HTML.


**A template consists of static parts of the desired HTML output as well as some special syntax describing how dynamic content will be inserted.**

## Why Django Template?

* In HTML file, we can't write python code because the code is only interpreted by python interpreter not the browser. We know that HTML is a static markup language, while Python is a dynamic programming language.

* Django template engine is used to separate the design from the python code and allows us to build dynamic web pages.
